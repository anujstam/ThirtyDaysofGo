# ThirtyDaysofGo
My solutions for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code challenge using (mainly) Go

Each day passes all test cases and recieves full points for the challenge. This does not mean that any of the solutions here are optimal or the best. They're just the first ones that I came up with that worked.

Certain days do not allow Go to be used. Those problems have been solved using Python3 if allowed or another suitable language. A solution with Go has also been made in some cases where applicable, but those cannot be submitted online.

The following days do not have a corresponding solution in Go in this repository :
12, 13, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 27
