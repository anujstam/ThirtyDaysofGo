# ThirtyDaysofGo
My solutions for Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code challenge using Go

Each day passes all test cases and recieves full points for the challenge. This does not mean that any of the solutions here are optimal or the best. They're just the first ones that I came up with that worked.

Code is uploaded as and when the challenge is solved (ie usually one problem per day, until the 30 days are done)

Certain days that use object oriented programming do not allow Go to be used. Those problems have been solved using Python3. An attemp with go structs may be made in the future
